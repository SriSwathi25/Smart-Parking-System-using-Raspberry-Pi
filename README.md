# Smart-Parking-System-using-Raspberry-Pi

â€¢	This project will automate the detection of available and occupied parking spots using ultrasonic sensors. This solution is up to save you from unnecessary trips looking for a parking spot. The system will use a Raspberry Pi to monitor parking spots in real-time and send the data to an API, to integrate with external systems. Will leverage AI using machine learning algorithms to provide users with insights into when certain parking spots are likely to be available based on past usage patterns.
